# Preference file for rtf2latex2e

# Comments should be preceded by '#' in each line.

# Here are some basic preferences you might want to set. Do not change
# the names of the preferences, or add any. The preferences can be in 
# any order. 'true' and 'false' values are allowed for appropriate
# preferences.

# Line that is inserted before \documentclass{}
# Typically starts with % 
preambleFirstText        %&pdfLaTeX

# Another line, just like the one above
# Enclose in quotes because value contains spaces
preambleSecondText       '% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode'

# This is your chance to customize the type of latex document created
preambleDocClass         \documentclass{article}

# specify the output map file to map between RTF and LaTeX characters.
# This is the character set used for the characters in the emitted latex.
# Examples are 
#      latex-encoding          (default unicode), 
#      latex-encoding.applemac (uses applemac input encoding), 
#      latex-encoding.cp1252   (uses cp1252 input encoding)

# Default page width in inches.  US Letter is 8.5, A4 paper is 8.3

pageWidth	8.5

# Default left margin of page in inches, ignored if convertPageSize is false
pageLeft	1.0

# Default right margin of page in inches, ignored if convertPageSize is false
pageRight	1.0

# use above sizes to set the extent of the LaTeX page
convertPageSize	false

# convert RTF heading 1, 2, & 3. For example, 'heading 2' --> \subsection{...}
convertParagraphStyle	true

# convert paragraph indenting using \parindent
# this adds some extra markup, but does a decent job of making sure that
# non-indented and multiply-indented paragraphs get indented properly
convertParagraphIndent	true

# convert space between paragraphs using \vspace{} 
convertInterParagraphSpace	true

# adjust latex margins according to those for each paragraph
convertParagraphMargin	true

# allow paragraphs to be centered or flush right
convertParagraphAlignment	true

# convert line spacing using \baselineskip ... eventually will use \setspace{}
convertLineSpacing	true

# convert changes in the font size.  Disabling this is not unreasonable because
# LaTeX often makes reasonable assumptions about the font size.
# and it is a nuisance if every paragraph is bracketed with {\Large ... }
# because the RTF document was written in 14 point font.
convertTextSize	true

#convert text styles.  includes bold, italics, smallcaps, underline, doubleunderline
convertTextForm	true

#if true then replace tabs with spaces, otherwise replace with \tab 
convertTextNoTab	true

# translate color text formatting.  This is annoying because the entire RTF color table
# always gets written to the LaTeX file and therefore inserts a bunch of noise at
# in the preamble
convertTextColor	true

#convert hypertext links using url package
convertHypertext	false

# convert embedded Equation Editor objects. If false or if the conversion 
# fails, the image associated with the equation inserted in the latex file.
convertEquation	true

# when converting an RTF file that contains embedded images, these all must
# be extracted into the local directory.  This can create a huge number of
# files in the current directory.  If this option is true, then a new directory
# called 'file-latex' is created and the converted images and the converted
# latex file are placed inside
convertAsDirectory false

# Name of environment for tables.  The default is "tabular"
