QR decomposition of a rectangular matrix of size MxN

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that QP decomposition  is  harder  to
  ! parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix  product  -  this  algorithm  has
  ! many internal synchronization points which can not be avoided. However
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting  from  N=512,   achieving
  ! near-linear speedup for N=4096 or higher.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

Input parameters:
    A   -   matrix A whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    M   -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N   -   number of columns in matrix A.

Output parameters:
    A   -   matrices Q and R in compact form (see below).
    Tau -   array of scalar factors which are used to form
            matrix Q. Array whose index ranges within [0.. Min(M-1,N-1)].

Matrix A is represented as A = QR, where Q is an orthogonal matrix of size
MxM, R - upper triangular (or upper trapezoid) matrix of size M x N.

The elements of matrix R are located on and above the main diagonal of
matrix A. The elements which are located in Tau array and below the main
diagonal of matrix A are used to form matrix Q as follows:

Matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflections

Q = H(0)*H(2)*...*H(k-1),

where k = min(m,n), and each H(i) is in the form

H(i) = 1 - tau * v * (v^T)

where tau is a scalar stored in Tau[I]; v - real vector,
so that v(0:i-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, v(i+1:m-1) stored in A(i+1:m-1,i).

Partial unpacking of matrix Q from LQ decomposition of a complex matrix A.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes two  important  improvements  of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  ! * multicore support
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Say, on SSE2-capable CPU with N=1024, HPC ALGLIB will be:
  ! * about 2-3x faster than ALGLIB for C++ without MKL
  ! * about 7-10x faster than "pure C#" edition of ALGLIB
  ! Difference in performance will be more striking  on  newer  CPU's with
  ! support for newer SIMD instructions. Generally,  MKL  accelerates  any
  ! problem whose size is at least 128, with best  efficiency achieved for
  ! N's larger than 512.
  !
  ! Commercial edition of ALGLIB also supports multithreaded  acceleration
  ! of this function. We should note that QP decomposition  is  harder  to
  ! parallelize than, say, matrix-matrix  product  -  this  algorithm  has
  ! many internal synchronization points which can not be avoided. However
  ! parallelism starts to be profitable starting  from  N=512,   achieving
  ! near-linear speedup for N=4096 or higher.
  !
  ! In order to use multicore features you have to:
  ! * use commercial version of ALGLIB
  ! * call  this  function  with  "smp_"  prefix,  which  indicates  that
  !   multicore code will be used (for multicore support)
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

orthogonal transformations P and Q: A = Q*B*(P^T).

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  !
  ! Multithreaded acceleration is NOT supported for this function  because

  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

Input parameters:
    A       -   source matrix. array[0..M-1, 0..N-1]
    M       -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N       -   number of columns in matrix A.

Output parameters:
    A       -   matrices Q, B, P in compact form (see below).
    TauQ    -   scalar factors which are used to form matrix Q.
    TauP    -   scalar factors which are used to form matrix P.

The main diagonal and one of the  secondary  diagonals  of  matrix  A  are
replaced with bidiagonal  matrix  B.  Other  elements  contain  elementary
reflections which form MxM matrix Q and NxN matrix P, respectively.

If M>=N, B is the upper  bidiagonal  MxN  matrix  and  is  stored  in  the
corresponding  elements  of  matrix  A.  Matrix  Q  is  represented  as  a
product   of   elementary   reflections   Q = H(0)*H(1)*...*H(n-1),  where
H(i) = 1-tau*v*v'. Here tau is a scalar which is stored  in  TauQ[i],  and
vector v has the following  structure:  v(0:i-1)=0, v(i)=1, v(i+1:m-1)  is
stored   in   elements   A(i+1:m-1,i).   Matrix   P  is  as  follows:  P =
G(0)*G(1)*...*G(n-2), where G(i) = 1 - tau*u*u'. Tau is stored in TauP[i],
u(0:i)=0, u(i+1)=1, u(i+2:n-1) is stored in elements A(i,i+2:n-1).

If M<N, B is the  lower  bidiagonal  MxN  matrix  and  is  stored  in  the
corresponding   elements  of  matrix  A.  Q = H(0)*H(1)*...*H(m-2),  where
H(i) = 1 - tau*v*v', tau is stored in TauQ, v(0:i)=0, v(i+1)=1, v(i+2:m-1)
is    stored    in   elements   A(i+2:m-1,i).    P = G(0)*G(1)*...*G(m-1),
G(i) = 1-tau*u*u', tau is stored in  TauP,  u(0:i-1)=0, u(i)=1, u(i+1:n-1)
is stored in A(i,i+1:n-1).

EXAMPLE:

m=6, n=5 (m > n):               m=5, n=6 (m < n):

(  d   e   u1  u1  u1 )         (  d   u1  u1  u1  u1  u1 )
(  v1  d   e   u2  u2 )         (  e   d   u2  u2  u2  u2 )
(  v1  v2  d   e   u3 )         (  v1  e   d   u3  u3  u3 )
(  v1  v2  v3  d   e  )         (  v1  v2  e   d   u4  u4 )
(  v1  v2  v3  v4  d  )         (  v1  v2  v3  e   d   u5 )
(  v1  v2  v3  v4  v5 )

Here vi and ui are vectors which form H(i) and G(i), and d and e -
are the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of matrix B.

Input parameters:
    A       -   matrix to be transformed
                array with elements [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
    N       -   size of matrix A.
    IsUpper -   storage format. If IsUpper = True, then matrix A is given
                by its upper triangle, and the lower triangle is not used
                and not modified by the algorithm, and vice versa
                if IsUpper = False.

Output parameters:
    A       -   matrices T and Q in  compact form (see lower)
    Tau     -   array of factors which are forming matrices H(i)
                array with elements [0..N-2].

                array with elements [0..N-2].


  If IsUpper=True, the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(n-2) . . . H(2) H(0).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(i+1:n-1) = 0, v(i) = 1, v(0:i-1) is stored on exit in
  A(0:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

  If IsUpper=False, the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary
  reflectors

     Q = H(0) H(2) . . . H(n-2).

  Each H(i) has the form

     H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

  where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
  v(0:i) = 0, v(i+1) = 1, v(i+2:n-1) is stored on exit in A(i+2:n-1,i),
  and tau in TAU(i).

  The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples
  with n = 5:

  if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

    (  d   e   v1  v2  v3 )              (  d                  )

  where d and e denote diagonal and off-diagonal elements of T, and vi
  denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
