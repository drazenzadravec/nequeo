Singular value decomposition of a rectangular matrix.

COMMERCIAL EDITION OF ALGLIB:

  ! Commercial version of ALGLIB includes one  important  improvement   of
  ! this function, which can be used from C++ and C#:
  ! * Intel MKL support (lightweight Intel MKL is shipped with ALGLIB)
  !
  ! Intel MKL gives approximately constant  (with  respect  to  number  of
  ! worker threads) acceleration factor which depends on CPU  being  used,
  ! problem  size  and  "baseline"  ALGLIB  edition  which  is  used   for
  ! comparison.
  !
  ! Generally, commercial ALGLIB is several times faster than  open-source
  ! generic C edition, and many times faster than open-source C# edition.
  !
  ! Multithreaded acceleration is only partially supported (some parts are
  ! optimized, but most - are not).
  !
  ! We recommend you to read 'Working with commercial version' section  of
  ! ALGLIB Reference Manual in order to find out how to  use  performance-
  ! related features provided by commercial edition of ALGLIB.

The algorithm calculates the singular value decomposition of a matrix of
size MxN: A = U * S * V^T

The algorithm finds the singular values and, optionally, matrices U and V^T.
The algorithm can find both first min(M,N) columns of matrix U and rows of
matrix V^T (singular vectors), and matrices U and V^T wholly (of sizes MxM
and NxN respectively).

Take into account that the subroutine does not return matrix V but V^T.

Input parameters:
    A           -   matrix to be decomposed.
                    Array whose indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..N-1].
    M           -   number of rows in matrix A.
    N           -   number of columns in matrix A.
    UNeeded     -   0, 1 or 2. See the description of the parameter U.
    VTNeeded    -   0, 1 or 2. See the description of the parameter VT.
    AdditionalMemory -
                    If the parameter:
                     * equals 0, the algorithm doesn’t use additional
                       memory (lower requirements, lower performance).
                     * equals 1, the algorithm uses additional
                       memory of size min(M,N)*min(M,N) of real numbers.
                       It often speeds up the algorithm.
                     * equals 2, the algorithm uses additional
                       memory of size M*min(M,N) of real numbers.
                       It allows to get a maximum performance.
                    The recommended value of the parameter is 2.

Output parameters:
    W           -   contains singular values in descending order.
    U           -   if UNeeded=0, U isn't changed, the left singular vectors
                    are not calculated.
                    if Uneeded=1, U contains left singular vectors (first
                    min(M,N) columns of matrix U). Array whose indexes range
                    within [0..M-1, 0..Min(M,N)-1].
                    if UNeeded=2, U contains matrix U wholly. Array whose
                    indexes range within [0..M-1, 0..M-1].
    VT          -   if VTNeeded=0, VT isn’t changed, the right singular vectors
                    are not calculated.
                    if VTNeeded=1, VT contains right singular vectors (first
                    min(M,N) rows of matrix V^T). Array whose indexes range
                    within [0..min(M,N)-1, 0..N-1].
                    if VTNeeded=2, VT contains matrix V^T wholly. Array whose
                    indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].
