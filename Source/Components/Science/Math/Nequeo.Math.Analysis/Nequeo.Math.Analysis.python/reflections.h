/*************************************************************************
Generation of an elementary reflection transformation

The subroutine generates elementary reflection H of order N, so that, for
a given X, the following equality holds true:

    ( X(1) )   ( Beta )
H * (  ..  ) = (  0   )
    ( X(n) )   (  0   )

where
              ( V(1) )
H = 1 - Tau * (  ..  ) * ( V(1), ..., V(n) )
              ( V(n) )

where the first component of vector V equals 1.

Input parameters:
    X   -   vector. Array whose index ranges within [1..N].
    N   -   reflection order.

Output parameters:
    X   -   components from 2 to N are replaced with vector V.
            The first component is replaced with parameter Beta.
    Tau -   scalar value Tau. If X is a null vector, Tau equals 0,
            otherwise 1 <= Tau <= 2.

This subroutine is the modification of the DLARFG subroutines from
the LAPACK library.

MODIFICATIONS:
    24.12.2005 sign(Alpha) was replaced with an analogous to the Fortran SIGN code.

/*************************************************************************
Application of an elementary reflection to a rectangular matrix of size MxN

The algorithm pre-multiplies the matrix by an elementary reflection transformation
which is given by column V and scalar Tau (see the description of the
GenerateReflection procedure). Not the whole matrix but only a part of it
is transformed (rows from M1 to M2, columns from N1 to N2). Only the elements
of this submatrix are changed.

Input parameters:
    C       -   matrix to be transformed.
    Tau     -   scalar defining the transformation.
    V       -   column defining the transformation.
                Array whose index ranges within [1..M2-M1+1].
    M1, M2  -   range of rows to be transformed.
    N1, N2  -   range of columns to be transformed.
    WORK    -   working array whose indexes goes from N1 to N2.

Output parameters:
    C       -   the result of multiplying the input matrix C by the
                transformation matrix which is given by Tau and V.
                If N1>N2 or M1>M2, C is not modified.
