/*************************************************************************
Conversion from barycentric representation to Chebyshev basis.
This function has O(N^2) complexity.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    P   -   polynomial in barycentric form
    A,B -   base interval for Chebyshev polynomials (see below)
            A<>B

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    T   -   coefficients of Chebyshev representation;
            P(x) = sum { T[i]*Ti(2*(x-A)/(B-A)-1), i=0..N-1 },
            where Ti - I-th Chebyshev polynomial.

NOTES:
    barycentric interpolant passed as P may be either polynomial  obtained
    from  polynomial  interpolation/ fitting or rational function which is
    NOT polynomial. We can't distinguish between these two cases, and this
    algorithm just tries to work assuming that P IS a polynomial.  If not,
    algorithm will return results, but they won't have any meaning.

Conversion from barycentric representation to power basis.
This function has O(N^2) complexity.

INPUT PARAMETERS:
    P   -   polynomial in barycentric form
    C   -   offset (see below); 0.0 is used as default value.
    S   -   scale (see below);  1.0 is used as default value. S<>0.

OUTPUT PARAMETERS
    A   -   coefficients, P(x) = sum { A[i]*((X-C)/S)^i, i=0..N-1 }
    N   -   number of coefficients (polynomial degree plus 1)

NOTES:
1.  this function accepts offset and scale, which can be  set  to  improve
    numerical properties of polynomial. For example, if P was obtained  as
    result of interpolation on [-1,+1],  you  can  set  C=0  and  S=1  and
    represent  P  as sum of 1, x, x^2, x^3 and so on. In most cases you it
    is exactly what you need.

    However, if your interpolation model was built on [999,1001], you will
    see significant growth of numerical errors when using {1, x, x^2, x^3}
    as basis. Representing P as sum of 1, (x-1000), (x-1000)^2, (x-1000)^3
    will be better option. Such representation can be  obtained  by  using
    1000.0 as offset C and 1.0 as scale S.

2.  power basis is ill-conditioned and tricks described above can't  solve
    this problem completely. This function  will  return  coefficients  in
    any  case,  but  for  N>8  they  will  become unreliable. However, N's
    less than 5 are pretty safe.
    
3.  barycentric interpolant passed as P may be either polynomial  obtained
    from  polynomial  interpolation/ fitting or rational function which is
    NOT polynomial. We can't distinguish between these two cases, and this
    algorithm just tries to work assuming that P IS a polynomial.  If not,
    algorithm will return results, but they won't have any meaning.
