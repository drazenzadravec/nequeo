/*************************************************************************
Generation of an elementary complex reflection transformation

The subroutine generates elementary complex reflection H of  order  N,  so
that, for a given X, the following equality holds true:

     ( X(1) )   ( Beta )
H' * (  ..  ) = (  0   ),   H'*H = I,   Beta is a real number
     ( X(n) )   (  0   )

where

              ( V(1) )
H = 1 - Tau * (  ..  ) * ( conj(V(1)), ..., conj(V(n)) )
              ( V(n) )

where the first component of vector V equals 1.

Input parameters:
    X   -   vector. Array with elements [1..N].
    N   -   reflection order.

Output parameters:
    X   -   components from 2 to N are replaced by vector V.
            The first component is replaced with parameter Beta.
    Tau -   scalar value Tau.

This subroutine is the modification of CLARFG subroutines  from the LAPACK
library. It has similar functionality except for the fact that it  doesn’t
handle errors when intermediate results cause an overflow.

/*************************************************************************
Application of an elementary reflection to a rectangular matrix of size MxN

The  algorithm  pre-multiplies  the  matrix  by  an  elementary reflection
transformation  which  is  given  by  column  V  and  scalar  Tau (see the
description of the GenerateReflection). Not the whole matrix  but  only  a
part of it is transformed (rows from M1 to M2, columns from N1 to N2). Only
the elements of this submatrix are changed.

Note: the matrix is multiplied by H, not by H'.   If  it  is  required  to
multiply the matrix by H', it is necessary to pass Conj(Tau) instead of Tau.

Input parameters:
    C       -   matrix to be transformed.
    Tau     -   scalar defining transformation.
    V       -   column defining transformation.
                Array whose index ranges within [1..M2-M1+1]
    M1, M2  -   range of rows to be transformed.
    N1, N2  -   range of columns to be transformed.
    WORK    -   working array whose index goes from N1 to N2.

Output parameters:
    C       -   the result of multiplying the input matrix C by the
                transformation matrix which is given by Tau and V.
                If N1>N2 or M1>M2, C is not modified.
